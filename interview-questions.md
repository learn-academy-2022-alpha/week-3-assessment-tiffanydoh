# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: The keyword "this" refers to the object that is currently or specifically being invoked in a function.

  Researched answer: When calling a function as a method of the object, using "this" refers to that specific object being used or being referred to. 



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. React contains code snippet that is reusable. It is component based. 

  Researched answer: React is a front-end Javascript Library that is used for building user interfaces. It can be used to create web applications and mobile apps. Because React is a library, it has reusuable code snippers and other UI components that allows it to be usuable. 



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: render() is required in a React class component. By using render(), it presents the specified HTML on the webpage. 

  Researched answer: In React, render() method is the only required method in a class component. It describes how the webpage should display the HTML element and tags. We are able to read React props and states.


4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a hybrid between HTML and Javascript.  JSX fragments ( <> </>) can be used to turn HTML tags into react elements. The difference between HTML and JSX is that HTML is a markup language that allows for creating a structure of a page. But with JSX, it is like an extension where HTML can be used within Javascript code. 

  Researched answer: JSX is Javascript XML. JSX allows us to work with HTML in React within a Javascript code. It is easier for HTML to be changed or used. HTML is the standard langauge that makes the structure of a page. JSX on the other hand, allows developers to write HTML with their javascript code in React. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package manager. It organizes node modules. 

  Researched answer: Once yarn runs, it is going to unpack all the stored dependencies that will aloow HTML and Javascript to interact together. When yarn is run, the files that get added are the node modules, package.json, yarn.lock, and .gitignore.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I believe an anonymous function in Javascript is an unknown function.

  Researched answer: Anoymous Function is a function that does not have a name affiliated with it. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Works similar to how Javascript conditions work. In React, conditional rendering renders different components based on a condition. You can create many different components with different behaviors, and it will only render some of it depending on what your conditions are. 

2. Props: Props is used to pass information (data and methods) from the parent component to the child component. They are considered "Read Only" because they cannot be changed/updated. 

3. JavaScript Events: Javascript Events is Javascript coded resposnes that interact with an HTML event. HTML events occur when either the user or browser manipulates a page. For example, we have worked with onClick which is a common event type. We can have Javascript code interact with this event by having something happen when something is clicked. 

4. Object-oriented programming (OOP): OOP is a computer programming model based on objects. OOP are closely binded or linked to their functions and allows no modication from outside functions. 

5. Ruby: Ruby is a backend language that uses object-oriented programming. Known for its simplicity, Ruby is general-purpose, dynamic, interpreted, and works on the server side of scriping language.
